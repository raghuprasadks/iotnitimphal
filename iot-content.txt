ABOUT THE WORKSHOP:
The workshop is intended to cover the advance IOT. The Internet of things is the internet working of physical devices, vehicles, buildings and other items—embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity that enable these objects to collect and exchange data.
During the course of workshop students will be leveraged to integrate concepts like modeling of design through real time hands-on practical sessions.
